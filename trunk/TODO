critical areas
	mounts /dev/md0 as r/o ? /etc/rc modified to remount as rw
	group users need /usr/sbin/pwd_mkdb -p /etc/master.passwd  added to /etc/rc
	make snmpd build without input
	firmware.img needs to be added to iso so you can install.  what is firmware.img ?

areas to investigate impact
	trys to mound md0 not md0a , so i build for md0 now
	mklibs complains . file not found, this is because of links
	atareinit.c not found to compile in freebsd6 repo
	if_vlan.ko and if_tap.ko not to be found except in /boot/kernel
	disklabel doesn't have -s option anymore
	freebsd6 repo m0n0wall.files has bin/[:bin/test

areas to improve
	support for ALIX/WRAP GENERICwithSerial
	support for differet image outputs
	scripts to reverse the build scripts so you can do a clean build
