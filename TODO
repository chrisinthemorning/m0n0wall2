critical areas
	kernel patches for a few things
		ehci_pci patch has nothing to patch , files have moved ?
		not testing geode.c.orig.patch yet
		if_vr.c is now in ./sys/dev/vr/if_vr.c patch fails
		dummynet now in sys/netinet/ipfw/ip_dummynet.c  patch fails
		ip_input.c. patch fails
		vfs_mount.c fails 
		

areas to investigate impact
    GEOM errors on boot
    some kernel features removed, drivers and ipf maxstates
	trys to mount md0 not md0a , so i build for md0 now
	mklibs complains . file not found, this is because of links
	atareinit.c not found to compile in freebsd6 repo
	if_vlan.ko and if_tap.ko not to be found except in /boot/kernel
	disklabel doesn't have -s option anymore
	freebsd6 repo m0n0wall.files has bin/[:bin/test


areas to improve
	support for ALIX/WRAP GENERICwithSerial
	support for different image outputs
	scripts to reverse the build scripts so you can do a clean build
